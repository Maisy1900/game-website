						<h2>Pre-submission 3 work</h2>
						<p>
							Through a unified consensus in the group, we decided to create a turn-based game called Incursion. The unique selling point of the game was to place a modern multiplayer twist on the genre so people could play and strategize together to defeat a common foe (this also satisfied the specification requirements). Incursion is a game about restoring human rule over territories which have been hijacked by Orcs. Both players will work together to work up the ranks with each time conquering a more formidable opponent. While progressing, they will improve their deck and become stronger in preparations for the final battle. <br>

							In order to achieve our objectives and provide some deliverables for each submission, we divided into teams which would focus on a specific task in the submission, these teams differed and changed through the course of the work with extra knowledge of team members strengths and weaknesses, this combined with weekly meetings allowed for us to successfully:<br>
							•	Create a Hack<br>
							•	Create a website (with custom art)<br>
							•	File documentation<br>
							With further meetings with the Critic and the Advisors, we were ready to once again reshuffle so we could better achieve our targets for the 3rd submission.

						<h2>Submission 3 work</h2>
						<p>
							Within submission 3, there are far less deliverables which allowed us to collaborate more on the work. To profit from this, we split ourselves into groups based upon ability and time management for certain members. The teams were to be focused on Programming and Website. This insured that more people could adapt to one goal encouraging communication and team cohesion. The teams communicated through Whatsapp Group chats and Discord servers. 
						</p>
						<h2>MVP:</h2>
						<p>
							After the 2nd submission went through, we received a lot of advice on how to implement Multiplayer from Antonio. Digesting the information, we decided to continue with implementing multiplayer with LibGDX as part of the work was already completed with it. They had already managed to produce a program where a card was visible on the screen alongside a monster and HUD (Heads-up display):

						<h2>New changes</h2>
						<h2>Update 3.1</h2>
						<p>
							In order to make the experience better for you, the Incursion team has collectively decided to create a list of things that we are implementing to make the user experience better for you:<br>
							•	User Interface <br>
							•	Screen Switching<br>
							•	Original Game art<br>
							These changes once implemented will make users feel more in control and provide a familiar feeling that other games provide for optimum user experience.

						</p>
						<h2>Update 3.2</h2>
						<p>
							After researching and attempting to continue with our plans, the Programming team (Deepanker, Khalid and Robbie) have hit snags in their development, this was because the programming source LibGDX was becoming far too difficult and tedious to uphold all the work they aimed to do, as a result of this the team is now searching for a new method of game development, stay tuned for updates!
						</p>
						<h2>Update 3.3</h2>
						<p>
							Success! The programming team have successfully made the switch from LibGDX to Unity in an extra effort to get their projects done on time. This change will bring many advancements are we can now also brainstorm new ideas for future additions and further improve the game for you. Look forward to more updates.
						</p>
						<h2>Update 3.4</h2>
						<p>
							The team has been hard at work progressing with Unity and ensuring we meet the promises we have made to the users. The programming team have accomplished …

						<h2>Website</h2>
						<h2>Update 3.1</h2>
						<p>The Website team at Incursion (Maisy, Huzaifa, Ayra and Keene) want to extend the gaming experience seamlessly over to the Incursion website, for this the team has come up with brand new concepts which are going to be added to the website for our fans enjoyment:<br>
							•	News section<br>
							•	Help section<br>
							•	Login Page<br>
							These pages will be dedicated directly for the users in order to make the game more entertaining and provide help on what to do in-game.
