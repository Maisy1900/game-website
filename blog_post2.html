						This document will contain a series of blog posts and updates made to the various sections of the game; the document will be split and will contain the following:<br>
						Submission 3 demo<br>
						Break<br>
						Submission 5 (Complete software system) updates<br>
						Website updates.
					</p>

					</section>
					<section id="presubmission">
						<h2>Submission 3 demo</h2>
						<p>
							The reason for the demo was to show off the game and what we have done so far in our development process. We initially showed our website explaining a bit about the game the selling point of it, how to navigate the website and about the story we created behind the game. We then explained the game, how to play it so far and showing what we had produced. The demo went well we could have improved it by preparing better but now we can learn for the future demo. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<h2>Break</h2>
					<p>
						After our submission 3 demo, we took a break to focus on our exams from 14/12/2020 to 28/01/2021.
					</p>
					<section id ="submission">
						<h2>Demo & Game Feedback </h2>
						<p>
							After the break, we met with the Critic, and other advisors to give us feedback on our submission 3 demo. They gave us advice regarding presenting a good demo, by explaining what we did well in our demo and how we could have improved. We learned that we need to improve on presenting our game for our next demonstration, by focusing on showing off the features of the game rather than what is not there to be improved on. We were also advised to focus on multiplayer due to it being a key deliverable that we had still not met. 
						</p>

						<h2>Submission 5 </h2>
						<p>
							Once we had the feedback from our demo, we could start making some progress developing the game and website using the critiques and advice given. Since we got back on track after the sudden switch last term, we found that we were progressing well developing in Unity in comparison to LibGDX, so we decided to continue using Unity for the rest of the development. 
						</p>

					

						<h2>New changes</h2>
						<h2>Update 4.1</h2>
						<p>
							To complete the game meeting a good scope our team created a list of tasks to complete based on feedback given, to help organise our development, and features we want to add to make the game high quality and enjoyable to play when complete:<br>
							•	Integrate multiplayer,<br>
							•	Increase number of unity team members,<br>
							•	Game hosting,<br>
							•	Improve UI,<br>
							•	Create additional game features,<br>
							-	Monster targeting,<br>
							-	Health bar,<br>
							-	More card effects.

						</p>
						<h2>Update 4.2</h2>
						<p>
							The development team began focusing on learning how to implement multiplayer into the current game. There was a lot more hope at this stage compared to with LibGDX as the game was made and there seemed to be many more resources to learn about multiplayer integration online in unity.
						</p>
						<h2>Update 4.3</h2>
						<p>
							Now the development team have the knowledge to create the multiplayer game the development team began integrating multiplayer into the battle system. The game so far was quite simple so despite needing some time for initial research it didn’t take as long as other methods to progress. Now we have started integrating multiplayer into the game we could start working on improving the game, creating additional game functionality.

						<h2>Update 4.4</h2>
						<p>
							The programming team has been working as fast as they can but with only 3 people, we wanted to look for a way to increase the number of people that can help out. We found we could increase the number of people by upgrading to unity student pro, it took a couple of days to set up but when we figured it out, we had 2 extra spaces and could work on the game a lot quicker. 
						</p>
						<h2>Update 4.5</h2>
						<p>
							Now the development teams’ team focus is to improve the game features and to continue integrating multiplayer on the features created. <br>
							The team developed a card drawing script that instantiates the cards at run time so the cards can be removed and changed when played.<br>
							We tried to create a monster targeting system that would allow multiple monsters on the screen so you could choose which one you would pick to fight, but it was too difficult for the scope of the game given the time frame. Instead, we decided on just one monster spawning per round.<br>
							As cards are the main game mechanic, we created a heal card to increase the strategy of the game as the enemies you fight will be difficult and you will need to heal at some points. <br>
							We made some UI improvements by adding a health bar instead of listing the health’s of the players and enemies, as well as improving the view of the message log. We also changed the layout of the game to make it more pleasing in general. 
						</p>
						<h2>Update 4.6</h2>
						<p>
							As the game is complete, we are focusing on hosting allowing the players to play against each other online. 
						</p>


					</section>
					<section id ="Website">
						<h2>Website</h2>
						<h2>Update 4.1</h2>
						<p>
							Since the website did not need many updates as it was quite complete the website team worked on making it more consistent so you will find it easier to navigate and with a pleasing design. We also worked on the help section when the game was complete to be as useful as possible.
